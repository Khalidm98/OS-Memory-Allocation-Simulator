# Qt - OS Memory Allocation Simulator

This Project simulates the operating system memory allocation technique using the segmentation method

The application support:
    Initializing the memory
    Allocating new processes using best-fit or first-fit algorithms
    Deallocation pre-allocated segments in initialization or user allocated segments

The application shows a drawing illustrating the memory layout after each operation
The application shows a the processes segments tables
